Folder structure for the game:
- usr: binaries that I would use as an individual
--- Example: usr/bin/grep.js
- bin: binaries that are system-wide, like hack or weaken or even a bash shell
- sbin: sudo bin, files that would normally be done as system admin. Do I need this?
- boot: files required for booting up the system (perhaps jupiterOS files can live in there?)
- etc: system configuration files
- lib: contains essential libraries for the /bin and /sbin directories
--- Note: libraries for files in /usr/bin are located in /usr/lib
- opt: optional packages. may be a good output location for logs
- var: variable data files, the writable counterpart to /usr. Logs are typically written to /var/log

                               // Daemon has access to the entire system, when it is finished nothing* should be running
                               // * exceptions may happen, but unlikely
